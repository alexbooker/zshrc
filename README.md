.zshrc
==========

Repository to save my custom ZSH settings and themes.

Install
-------
* Install [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) somewhere:

        mkdir ~/.antigen/ && cd ~/.antigen/
        curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsh-users/antigen/master/antigen.zsh > antigen.zsh
        source antigen.zsh

* Clone this repo somewhere:

        cd ~
        git clone git@github.com:asphxia/zsh.git

* Hook it into .zshrc

        echo "export ANTIGEN=~/.antigen/" >> ~/.zshrc # exports Antigen path
        echo "source ~/zsh/bootstrap.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc # loads out stuff

* Alternatively, use my .zshrc:

        mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.$(date +%s)
        ln -s ~/zsh/.zshrc

* Restart zsh and done!


Optional
--------

* Install autojump

        git clone git://github.com/joelthelion/autojump.git
        cd autojump
        ./install.sh

* Install fzf

        git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
        ~/.fzf/install

        rm ~/.fzf.zsh
        ln ~/.zshrc/.fzf.zsh ~/.fzf.zsh

Configure
---------

Check ``bootstrap.zsh`` for examples and default configuration.

If you run into problems with themes or the prompt run the following command and restart the shell:

    sed -i "s/prompt /#prompt /g" ~/.zshrc


Customize
-------
``bootstrap.zsh`` is reponsible for loading any custom script such as ``functions.sh``, ``aliases.sh`` and any custom library.

The files ``functions.sh`` and ``aliases.sh`` holds any custom function and aliases respectibly.

Custom themes are located at ``themes`` directory . Custom libraries are located at ``lib`` directory.

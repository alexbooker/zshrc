ZSH-CUSTOM
==========

Repository to save my custom ZSH (oh-my-shell) settings and themes.

Install
-------
* ``export ZSH_CUSTOM=$HOME/zsh-custom/``
* Done

Customize
-------
``bootstrap.zsh`` is loaded automagically by oh-my-sh and basically sets up some global configuration.
It is reposible for loading any custom script such as ``functions.sh``, ``aliases.sh`` and setting up the custom theme.

The files ``functions.sh`` and ``aliases.sh`` holds any custom function and aliases respectibly.

Custom themes are located in ``themes`` directory .
